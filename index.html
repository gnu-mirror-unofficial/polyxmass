<p>polyxmass is looking for a new maintainer; the original author has moved
to a Qt environment for a new version called <a
href="http://www.massxpert.org">massXpert</a> (<a
href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/massxpert/source/">source
available</a>).  For GNU to be a coherent system, we want all GNU
packages to support GTK.  Therefore the best approach is probably to
maintain polyxmass as a GTK port of massXpert.

<p>If you're interested, please take a look at this <a
href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about GNU
packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and interest.
Thanks!
