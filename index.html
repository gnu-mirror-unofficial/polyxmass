<body>
<p>polyxmass is looking for a new maintainer; the original author has moved
to a Qt environment for a new version called <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131029060133/http://massxpert.org/wiki/">
massXpert</a>.  For GNU to be a coherent system, we want all GNU
packages to support GTK.  Therefore the best approach is probably to
maintain polyxmass as a GTK port of massXpert.</p>

<p>The Polyxmass project page is at <a
href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/polyxmass/">
https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/polyxmass/</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>If you're interested, please take a look at this <a
href="/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about GNU
packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
&lt;<a href="mailto:maintainers@gnu.org">maintainers@gnu.org</a>&gt; with a
bit about your background and interest.
Thanks!</p>
